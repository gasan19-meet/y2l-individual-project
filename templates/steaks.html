<h1> IT'S STEAK TIME</h1>
<p>    Let the steak sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Season the steak generously on each side with salt and pepper.  In a cast-iron skillet with 1 Tablespoon of oil over high heat add the steaks to the pan and sear each side 3 minutes or until brown.



    Reduce heat to medium low.  Cook the steak to desired doneness.  Rare = 125 degrees, Medium Rare = 135 degrees, Medium = 145 degrees, Medium Well = 150 degrees and Well Done = 160 degrees.  Some say to flip only once while cooking, I like to flip mine a few times.


    Right before serving the steak slather the butter compound on top and let it melt into the tender steak.  This gives it a nice finishing touch and adds such great flavor.</p>
